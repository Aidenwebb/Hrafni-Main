# AgilePM Project Management
Study notes from Paul Bradley's course at https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/agile-project-management

## Introduction to Agile

### Agile Project Management Source
  * Based on DSDM (Dynamic Systems Development Method)

    * Originally launched in 1995 - rooted in RAD (Rapid Application Development)
  
  * Owned by DSDM Consortium
  * In 2014 AgilePM v2

  A common problem is blaming a framework or approach for project failure. Usually the true cause is that the approach was not implimented appropriately

### Agile Concerns and Issues
  * **Agile means no documentation:** You can have as much documentation as you like in Agile. Documentation is just another deliverable. If it brings you value, then schedule it and produce it like anything else
  * **Agile is only for IT projects:** No, Agile principles can be applied to any type of project
  * **Agile means no commitment:** Some thing that Agile teams don't make commitments -- it's just six to eight developers working until someone declares "We're done!". On the contrary, successful Agile teams are extremely realistic and transparent in what they promise to deliver.
  * **Agile means no planning:** No, again, Agile probably has more planning. Planning is spread out through the whole development exercise rather than at the front and it is the work of everybody rather than one or two appointed individuals.
  * **Develops do what they like:** Agile needs more disciple from the team and what gets done should be lead from a specific role, usually the Business Analyst. If developers are doing what they like, then there is a failure in communication or discipline. 


### What is Agile?
A generic style of working, taking a holistic view of projects rather than focusing on delivery techniques.
Ensures what you develop actually addresses the needs of the client 

  * Highest priority is satisfying the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable outputs
  * Ensure solution meets business needs with timely delivery
  * Deferring decisions about detail as late as possible where they can be data driven and decided based on facts rather than guesswork. Planning should be based on the current situation
  * A focus on flexibility. The principal of responding to change rather than following a plan. This doesn't mean agile is unplanned, but the plan should be at a macro rather than a micro scale

  
### Agile Approaches
Lightweight
  * Extreme Programming - software dev based on TDD and pair programming and CI, little management
  * LEAN - efficient processes, eliminating waste
  * Scrum - Delivery software in small chunks. Strength of Scrum is it's very simple but also a downfall as there's no concept of a project managing delivery of a finite piece of work.

Fuller
  * DSDM - designed to deliver projects in an Agile way
  * Agile Unified Process

### Agile Manifesto
We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value
  * People and Interactions over Processes and Tools
  * Working Software over Comprehensive Documentation
  * Customer Collaboration over Contract Negotiation
  * Responding to Change over Following A Plan

  While there is value in the right hand side, we prioritise the left


### Which Agile Approach
How to choose:
  * Lightweight agile approaches adequate for simple environments
  * Complex environment needs a fuller agile approach

    * Concept of "Project" management and delivery
    * Full lifecycle
    * Recognising the constraints of corporate culture
  * AgilePM is based on DSDM

    * Agility with Rigor

## Agile Project Management - The Basics

### The Basics
  * The philosophy overarches the way we do things
  * Supported and underpinned by 8 principals
  * Lifecycle supports principals. Key factors that need to be in place
  * Roles and responsibilities
  * Products produced, when they're created and how they evolve through subsequent phases
  * Techniques such as MoSCoW prioritisation, iterative development, time boxing and modelling
